# BDO Boss Timers #

## Description
This is a non official Android application, made by me and not by Kakao Games, Pearl Abyss or any other developers related to game Black Desert Online.  
In the app you can configure all kind of settings eg alert on specific boss(es) at specific day(s) for Black Desert Online. When the boss is about to spawn you well receive a notification at the configured time before the boss spawn.  
You will never miss the boss fight again.
