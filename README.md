# BDO Boss Timers #

This is a non official Android application, made by me and not by Kakao Games, Pearl Abyss or any other developers related to game Black Desert Online.  

## Description 
In the app you can configure all kind of settings eg alert on specific boss(es) at specific day(s) for Black Desert Online. When the boss is about to spawn you well receive a notification at the configured time before the boss spawn.  
You will never miss the boss fight again.

## Privacy
No personal data will be gathered while using the app.  
The correct spawn time is calculated by your current timezone parsed to the UTC+0 timezone.  
Your current timezone is received from the clock of the device, so NO precision Wifi or GPS methods are being used.

## Features
View the upcoming next bosses for the next 24 hours in the overview.  
BDO world bosses:  
* Garmoth  
* Karanda  
* Kutum  
* Kzarka  
* Muraka  
* Nouver  
* Offin  
* Quint  
* Vell  

Alerts can be set for a single region server of BDO.  
Supported BDO servers in the app:  
* EU  
* NA  
* SA  
* SEA 
* MENA 
* XBOX EU  
* XBOX NA  
* PS4 EU

* PS4 ASIA  

Configuration of alerts per day and per boss (can set multiple days and/or bosses at once).    
Configure a silent period (boss spawn won't be alerted in this period, eg during the night).
